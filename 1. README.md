# Path-Finder: Emergency Road/Path Alerts

## Project Overview

The program **"Path-Finder: Emergency Road/Path Alerts"**, is a console application that is based on the Java language. Its main purpose is to store and display **"path info"**, or alerts and information about places where roads are compromised and are needed to be avoided, it serves both local citizen users and LGU's to better plan rescue routes.Path-Finder's given features include a basic menu for path info submission, view table of given reports and an admin menu for updating already submitted path info into solved or safe.

## I. Features

* **Main Menu**
~ Path-Finder's first console run boasts a basic main menu system that contains the main functions of the program. It uses an integer and switch case statements to navigate (or exit) the console program.

```text
-----------------------------------
      Welcome to Path-Finder       
-----------------------------------
1. Submit a Path Info Report       
2. View All Path Info Reports      
3. Admin: Update Road Status       
4. Exit Path-Finder
===================================
Choose an option(#):
```

* **Path Info Submission**
~ Path-Finder's core functionality is to store and submit the aforementioned "path info" in order to disseminate the information quickly and easily for both local citizen users and LGU's. The submission console text gives three input entry lines that store the data by creating a new "*RoadReportEntry*" object and is added to the "*reports*" list.

```text
Choose an option(#): 1
Enter your name: Brent Draniel Aclan 
Enter location: Coliat, Ibaan, Batangas
Enter road status (Closed, Damaged, Under Maintenance): Closed
===================================
Report submitted successfully!
===================================
```

* **View All Path Info Reports**
~ After the submission of the given user, they can choose to view the stored path info. It also has an "*Post ID*" column to enumarate the number of submissions, it also stores the date and time the submission was made for specificity of the events of that time and date.
```text
Choose an option(#): 2
===================================
        PATH INFO REPORTS
===================================
Post ID: 1 | User: Brent Draniel Aclan | Location: Coliat, Ibaan, Batangas | Status: Damaged | Date: Sun Dec 08 15:42:26 PST 2024
Post ID: 2 | User: Johnathan Pather | Location: Balagtas, Batangas | Status: Closed | Date: Sun Dec 08 15:43:09 PST 2024
```

* **Admin Page**
~ The admin in charge of the program Path-Finder, can also alter the status of the path info submissions as either "Solved" or "Safe".
```text
Choose an option(#): 3
Submitted Paths:

Post ID: 1 | User: Brent Draniel Aclan | Location: Coliat, Ibaan, Batangas | Status: Damaged | Date: Sun Dec 08 15:42:26 PST 2024
Post ID: 2 | User: Johnathan Pather | Location: Balagtas, Batangas | Status: Closed | Date: Sun Dec 08 15:43:09 PST 2024
Enter Post ID to update: 1
Enter new status (Solved/Safe): Solved
Status updated successfully.
```

* **Exit Path-Finder**

```text
Choose an option(#): 4
-----------------------------------
See you later on the right Path!

```

## II. Usage Instructions

### 1. Download and Run the Program
~ After downloading the necessary files (.java), "Admin Board", "RoadReportEntry","RoadReport", and "RoadStatusManagement", compile it to the IDE you use and run.

### 2. Submit a Path Info
~ For your first time using Path-Finder, choose to submit a path info by inputting the appropriate integer listed in the terminal and input the following in the prompts:

a. Your name  
b. Location of the road  
c. Status of the road (Closed, Damaged, Under Maintenance)  

Once complete, it should be stored properly.

### 2. View Path Info
~ For viewership of the stored path info, choose 2 in the main menu to view the details of each path info submission. If there are none, it would display text with regards to the lack of data.

### 3. Administration of Path Info
~ For admins, they can choose 3. to go to the Admin Page and update each path info submission whether they are safe or solved, for the next displaying of path info or in the admin page, it would change appropriately to the given status update of the admin.

### 4. Exit Program
~ If finished with the program, users can input 4. to exit the console.


## III. Code Structure

### Class Descriptions

a. **`RoadReport` (Abstract Class)** : Has the concept of a path info.
* **Fields**: 
     1. `postId`: Auto-incremented ID for each submission
     2. `userName`: Name of user
     3. `location`: Location of the path info
     4. `roadStatus`: Status of the road (Closed, Damaged, Under Maintenance)
     5. `dateSubmitted`: Date when the report was submitted
     
   - **Methods**: 
     - `getPostId()`, `getUserName()`, `getLocation()`, `getRoadStatus()`, `getDateSubmitted()`: Getter methods for accessing the details of the path info
     - `setRoadStatus()`: A setter method that allows the update of the road's status (Safe/Solved)
     - `displayDetails()`: Displays path info details


b. **`RoadReportEntry` (Subclass of `RoadReport`)**
   - Represents a specific info path submitted by a user.
   - **Methods**: 
     - `displayDetails()`: Displays path info details


c. **`AdminBoard`**
   - Manages road reports at the admin page.
   - **Methods**:
     - `updateStatus()`: Method that allows the admin to update the status of a road report ("Solved" or "Safe"). It searches the given path infos by their `postId` and updates the status if found and valid. 


d. **`RoadStatusManagement`**
   - **Purpose**: Main code block of Path-Finder.
   - **Methods**:
     - `main()`: Method that shows the menu, handles user choices with numbers(1, 2, 3, 4) and calls the appropriate functionality for submitting reports, viewing reports, or updating the status.

## IV. OOP Principles in the Code

 1. **Encapsulation**
   - `RoadReport` encapsulates the private details of a path info submission, such as `postId`, `userName`, `location`, and `roadStatus`. The access to these fields is controlled through public getter and setter methods, `getPostId()`, `getUserName()`, `getLocation()`, `getRoadStatus()`, `getDateSubmitted()` for getting, `setRoadStatus()` for setting.
   - This ensures that the path info's data is protected, and the class provides a controlled interface for accessing and modifying these fields.

 2. **Inheritance**
   - The class `RoadReportEntry` inherits from the abstract class `RoadReport`. It allows `RoadReportEntry` to use the common properties and methods defined in `RoadReport` (such as `getPostId()`, `getLocation()`, `getRoadStatus()`, etc.), while also implementing the abstract method `displayDetails()` to show specific details of a road report.
   - The `RoadReport` class acts as a base, providing common functionality for all types of reports.

 3. **Polymorphism**
   - The method `displayDetails()` is overridden in the `RoadReportEntry` class. When `displayDetails()` is called on a `RoadReport` object, the appropriate version of the method is executed based on the actual object type (either `RoadReportEntry` or its subclasses).
   - This allows for flexibility and dynamic behavior in handling road report data.

 4. **Abstraction**
   - The `RoadReport` class is abstract, which means it provides a template for road reports without defining the exact implementation of how details are displayed.
   - The abstract method `displayDetails()` is implemented by the subclass `RoadReportEntry`, allowing the subclass to define how the details of a specific report are displayed. This allows for flexibility while maintaining a consistent structure for road reports.
